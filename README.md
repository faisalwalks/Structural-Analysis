# Structural Analysis
The structures developed in MathMod were imported into Fusion 360 as mesh files and then scaled to 70mm x 70mm x 70mm. The no.of polygons of the mesh were reduced to be made possible to be converted to solid Then using the mesh to Brep command in Fusion 360 converted into a solid and exported as .STP or .SAT files to be imported into ANSYS to perform analysis. The analysis was performed on two materials ABS and a zeolite polymer properties of which were taken from a research paper.
